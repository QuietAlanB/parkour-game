- player can roll

WALL BOOST:
a wall boost is something the player can do to gain speed and height
a wall boost is performed by pressing RCTRL while against a wall
a wall boost gives the player a small boost off of the wall they are up against and some upwards velocity
a "static" wall boost can be done by letting go of all movement keys and performing a wall boost, which will only give the player upwards velocity and no horizontal velocity
if a wall boost is done while falling, it will inflict fall damage on the player. this fall damage is much more than the regular fall damage
a wall boost uses 25 stamina

WALLCLIMB BOOST:
a wallclimb boost is something the player can do to gain a large amount of height
a wallclimb boost is performed by pressing W and moving into a wall (holding A or D depending on where the wall is)
a wallclimb boost gives the player a lot of upwards velocity which helps with climbing tall buildings
wallclimb boosts cannot be performed while fallng downwards
a wallclimb boost uses 25 stamina

DASH:
a dash is something the player can do to gain a lot of horizontal velocity
a dash can be performed by pressing F while holding A or D
a dash launches the player forward in the direction of the movement key they're holding
a dash gives the player a slight boost of velocity upwards as well
a dash has a cooldown of 1 second when used
a dash uses 30 stamina

ROLL:
a roll is something the player can do to negate fall damage
holding LSHIFT before hitting the ground at a high speed will negate all fall damage
falling TOO fast however will not allow a roll to negate fall damage, and will instead deal fall damage to the player
